== ABOUT CHOOKO LITE ==

Chooko Lite is a sweet, colorful and responsive theme for WordPress. Perfect for personal, fashion, beauty or cooking oriented blogs and creative websites.
It features two widgetizable areas (right or left sidebar and optional footer) and unlimited image slideshow.

Chooko Lite is the lite version of Chooko Pro, which comes with many additional features and access to premium class pro support forum and can be found at http://www.iceablethemes.com

== GETTING STARTED ==

Once you activate the theme from your WordPress admin panel, you will be automatically directed to the theme options page. From there you can:
* Upload your own logo
* Set a custom favicon (optional)
* Choose the sidebar's side for the blog (right or left)
* Add your own tracking code (such as Google Analytics) - the code you enter here will be hooked to wp_footer() and will fire at the bottom of every page on the front end.
* Customize the footer copyright note and link - You are free to change this to whatever you wish, but it would be greatly appreciated if you decide to keep the small link giving credit to the author!

== SPECIAL FEATURES INSTRUCTIONS ==

* Page Settings: While editing a Page in your WordPress admin panel, you will find an additional metabox on the right side called "Icefit Page Settings" under "Page Attributes". This allows you to choose whether to have a sidebar on the right, on the left, or no sidebar. You can also activate the slider and pick a slideshow to display on this page - you can do so by selecting either "All slides" or a category of slides to display. The last option allows to show or hide the page title (especially useful for static home page).

* Slideshows: Chooko Lite comes with an additional custom post type called "Slides". You can add and edit slides just like you would do with posts or pages. Each slide can have a title (for your own reference as this won't be displayed on the front-end), a featured image (the actual slide), and optionally a link URL to make it clickable and one or several categories if you want to organize them to create multiple slideshows. Slide images are recommended to be at least 960px width and any height, though it is highly recommended that your slides have all the same height for best results.

* Footer widgets: The widgetizable footer is disabled by default. To activate it, simply go to Appearance > Widgets and drop some widgets in the "Footer" area, just like you would do for the sidebar. It is recommended to use 4 widgets in the footer, or no widgets at all to disable it.
